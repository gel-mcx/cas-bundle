Installation
============

This package does not yet have a Symfony Flex recipe. Installation steps must be done manually.

Step 1
~~~~~~

The easiest way to install it is through Composer_

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require drupol/cas-bundle

Step 2
~~~~~~

Add the line `drupol\\CasBundle\\CasBundle::class => ['all' => true],` to `config/bundles.php` array.

Step 3
~~~~~~

Recursively copy the content of the `Resources/config` folder in `config/` folder.

.. code-block:: bash

    cp -ar vendor/drupol/cas-bundle/Resources/config/* config/

Step 4
~~~~~~

Create a configuration file `cas.yaml` in `config/packages`:

See more on the dedicated :ref:`configuration` page.

Step 5
~~~~~~

Register new firewall for CAS authentication, e.g.

.. code:: yaml

    firewalls:
        main:
            guard:
                provider: cas
                authenticators:
                    - cas.guardauthenticator

Example of configuration:

.. code:: yaml

    security:
        firewalls:
            dev:
                pattern: ^/(_(profiler|wdt)|css|images|js)/
                security: false
            main:
                anonymous: true
                provider: cas
                switch_user: true
                pattern: ^/
                guard:
                    authenticators:
                        - cas.guardauthenticator
        access_control:
            - { path: ^/api, role: ROLE_CAS_AUTHENTICATED }

Step 6
~~~~~~

The CAS protocol requires HTTPS on both side (client and server) in order
to communicate.

While it is not possible to configure the behavior of the CAS server, it is
possible to configure the HTTP client in use in this bundle in order to relax
the requirement and to disable SSL checks when communicating from the client
to the server.

.. warning:: Keep in mind that the following is only for development setup, not for production.

E.g: If you're using the default `symfony/http-client`_, you might need to add in
`config/framework.yaml`:

.. code:: yaml

framework:
    # ... Default stuff here
    http_client:
        default_options:
            verify_peer: false
            verify_host: false
